Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The insecure code does not sanitize the username provided by the get request.
By not doing so, it allows malicious users to inject NoSQL code and get more information in the response.
Furthermore, it sends a response whether the server could find the username, and doesn't error out if the get request does.
The secure code sanitizes the input and also encapsulates the request response in a try-catch.
It also ensures that the username given is a string, eliminating the opportunity to match via pattern.


Which CIA property does info disclosure violate?

Information Disclosure violates Confidentiality.


What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

You can additionally hide information from request URLs, handling the specific formation of the URL on the backend.
This would prevent users from being able to take advantage of request URL format.

Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerability here is how the session is being created and defined.
The insecure code sends a cookie to the user with the session ID created by the server.
A malicious user can find the session ID from the cookie and use that to gain access.
Furthermore, if a user is logged in, the session can be used to hit sensitive endpoints.

The secure version of the code sets cookie settings differently.
It creates session using a variable provided when the server starts (and isn't hard-coded).
More importantly, httpOnly is set to true, so generated cookies are not programmatically readable.
Furthermore, the session can be configured to set session only if the server and client are on
the same site (no cross-origin), so sessions received from that source can be trusted.

This kind of Spoofing attack violates Confidentiality, and can impact Integrity and Availability,
depending on how the malicious user utilizes their access to a specific application.
